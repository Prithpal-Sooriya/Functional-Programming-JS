# Functional Programming Practice in JS

This is my practice with FP in JS. Really liking map, filter and reduce - but time to get serious about it.

I will be following the [Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming](https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide) by Professor Franklin Frisby (Mostly Adequate).

Reasoning (for me) to use JS rather than purely functional languages is due to the urge to learn ReactJS and RamdaJS in the near future. <br>
Also looking into JS functional programming seems much cleaner compared to other languages (e.g. Java8 streams / Scala).

Will be using the `Quokka.js` extension in VSCode for code testing, but this project also can be ran using NodeJS.
